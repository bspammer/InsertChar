This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2810

Allows you to use <tab> <letter> to insert a single character (no need to press escape). You can also use 3<tab> <letter> to insert 3 characters.

If you install vimscript #2136, then the '.' command will also repeat the last insert.
